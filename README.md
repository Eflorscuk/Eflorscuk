I've been a web developer since 2018, with experience in several development languages ​​such as PHP, Javascript, Python, and currently, I want to improve my skills in the Ruby on Rails stack and work with this framework. I prefer backend development, although I have experience in frontend with Vue, React, Bootstrap, jQuery, etc.

I have worked in companies in the most diverse sectors, for example: Financial sector, Photography Service Subscription, Car Rental and Public Security.
